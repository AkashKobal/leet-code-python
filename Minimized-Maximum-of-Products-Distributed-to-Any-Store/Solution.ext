Input: n = 6, quantities = [11,6]
Output: 3
Explanation: One optimal way is:
- The 11 products of type 0 are distributed to the first four stores in these amounts: 2, 3, 3, 3
- The 6 products of type 1 are distributed to the other two stores in these amounts: 3, 3
The maximum number of products given to any store is max(2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3) = 3.
