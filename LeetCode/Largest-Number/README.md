# Largest Number

Can you solve this real interview question? Largest Number - Given a list of non-negative integers nums, arrange them such that they form the largest number and return it.

Since the result may be very large, so you need to return a string instead of an integer.

 

Example 1:


Input: nums = [10,2]
Output: "210"


Example 2:


Input: nums = [3,30,34,5,9]
Output: "9534330"
