# Length of Longest Fibonacci Subsequence

Can you solve this real interview question? Length of Longest Fibonacci Subsequence - A sequence x1, x2, ..., xn is Fibonacci-like if:

 * n >= 3
 * xi + xi+1 == xi+2 for all i + 2 <= n

Given a strictly increasing array arr of positive integers forming a sequence, return the length of the longest Fibonacci-like subsequence of arr. If one does not exist, return 0.

A subsequence is derived from another sequence arr by deleting any number of elements (including none) from arr, without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, [3, 5, 8] is a subsequence of [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8].

Example 1:


Input: arr = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
Output: 5
Explanation: The longest subsequence that is fibonacci-like: [1,2,3,5,8].

Example 2:


Input: arr = [1,3,7,11,12,14,18]
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest subsequence that is fibonacci-like: [1,11,12], [3,11,14] or [7,11,18].

## Solution
```py
class Solution:
    def lenLongestFibSubseq(self, arr: List[int]) -> int:
        val_to_idx = {num: i for i, num in enumerate(arr)}
        lookup = {}
        maxLength = 0

        for curr_pos, curr in enumerate(arr):
            lookup[curr] = defaultdict(lambda: 2)  # Default sequence length is 2
            for prev_pos in range(curr_pos - 1, -1, -1):
                prev = arr[prev_pos]
                prev2 = curr - prev  # The required number to form a Fibonacci-like sequence
                
                if prev2 >= prev:  # Ensure valid sequence ordering
                    break

                if prev2 in lookup:
                    lookup[curr][prev] = lookup[prev][prev2] + 1  # Extend sequence
                    maxLength = max(maxLength, lookup[curr][prev])

        return maxLength if maxLength > 2 else 0
```
