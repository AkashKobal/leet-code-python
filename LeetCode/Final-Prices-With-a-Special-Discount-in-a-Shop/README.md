# Final Prices With a Special Discount in a Shop

Can you solve this real interview question? Final Prices With a Special Discount in a Shop - You are given an integer array prices where prices[i] is the price of the ith item in a shop.

There is a special discount for items in the shop. If you buy the ith item, then you will receive a discount equivalent to prices[j] where j is the minimum index such that j > i and prices[j] <= prices[i]. Otherwise, you will not receive any discount at all.

Return an integer array answer where answer[i] is the final price you will pay for the ith item of the shop, considering the special discount.

 

Example 1:


Input: prices = [8,4,6,2,3]
Output: [4,2,4,2,3]
Explanation: 
For item 0 with price[0]=8 you will receive a discount equivalent to prices[1]=4, therefore, the final price you will pay is 8 - 4 = 4.
For item 1 with price[1]=4 you will receive a discount equivalent to prices[3]=2, therefore, the final price you will pay is 4 - 2 = 2.
For item 2 with price[2]=6 you will receive a discount equivalent to prices[3]=2, therefore, the final price you will pay is 6 - 2 = 4.
For items 3 and 4 you will not receive any discount at all.


Example 2:


Input: prices = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [1,2,3,4,5]
Explanation: In this case, for all items, you will not receive any discount at all.


Example 3:


Input: prices = [10,1,1,6]
Output: [9,0,1,6]

## Solution
```py
class Solution:
    def finalPrices(self, prices: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        n=len(prices)
        stack=[n-1]
        ans=[x for x in prices]
        for i in range(n-2, -1, -1):
            while stack and prices[i]<prices[stack[-1]]:
                stack.pop()
            if stack: ans[i]-=prices[stack[-1]]
            stack.append(i)
        return ans
