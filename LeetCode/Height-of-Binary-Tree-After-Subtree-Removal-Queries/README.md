# Height of Binary Tree After Subtree Removal Queries

Can you solve this real interview question? Height of Binary Tree After Subtree Removal Queries - You are given the root of a binary tree with n nodes. Each node is assigned a unique value from 1 to n. You are also given an array queries of size m.

You have to perform m independent queries on the tree where in the ith query you do the following:

 * Remove the subtree rooted at the node with the value queries[i] from the tree. It is guaranteed that queries[i] will not be equal to the value of the root.

Return an array answer of size m where answer[i] is the height of the tree after performing the ith query.

Note:

 * The queries are independent, so the tree returns to its initial state after each query.
 * The height of a tree is the number of edges in the longest simple path from the root to some node in the tree.

Example 1:

Input: root = [1,3,4,2,null,6,5,null,null,null,null,null,7], queries = [4]
Output: [2]
Explanation: The diagram above shows the tree after removing the subtree rooted at node with value 4.
The height of the tree is 2 (The path 1 -> 3 -> 2).


Example 2:

[https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2022/09/07/binaryytreeedrawio-2.png]


Input: root = [5,8,9,2,1,3,7,4,6], queries = [3,2,4,8]
Output: [3,2,3,2]
Explanation: We have the following queries:
- Removing the subtree rooted at node with value 3. The height of the tree becomes 3 (The path 5 -> 8 -> 2 -> 4).
- Removing the subtree rooted at node with value 2. The height of the tree becomes 2 (The path 5 -> 8 -> 1).
- Removing the subtree rooted at node with value 4. The height of the tree becomes 3 (The path 5 -> 8 -> 2 -> 6).
- Removing the subtree rooted at node with value 8. The height of the tree becomes 2 (The path 5 -> 9 -> 3).
