# Number of Ways to Form a Target String Given a Dictionary

Can you solve this real interview question? Number of Ways to Form a Target String Given a Dictionary - You are given a list of strings of the same length words and a string target.

Your task is to form target using the given words under the following rules:

 * target should be formed from left to right.
 * To form the ith character (0-indexed) of target, you can choose the kth character of the jth string in words if target[i] = words[j][k].
 * Once you use the kth character of the jth string of words, you can no longer use the xth character of any string in words where x <= k. In other words, all characters to the left of or at index k become unusuable for every string.
 * Repeat the process until you form the string target.

Notice that you can use multiple characters from the same string in words provided the conditions above are met.

Return the number of ways to form target from words. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 109 + 7.

Example 1:


Input: words = ["acca","bbbb","caca"], target = "aba"
Output: 6
Explanation: There are 6 ways to form target.
"aba" -> index 0 ("acca"), index 1 ("bbbb"), index 3 ("caca")
"aba" -> index 0 ("acca"), index 2 ("bbbb"), index 3 ("caca")
"aba" -> index 0 ("acca"), index 1 ("bbbb"), index 3 ("acca")
"aba" -> index 0 ("acca"), index 2 ("bbbb"), index 3 ("acca")
"aba" -> index 1 ("caca"), index 2 ("bbbb"), index 3 ("acca")
"aba" -> index 1 ("caca"), index 2 ("bbbb"), index 3 ("caca")


Example 2:


Input: words = ["abba","baab"], target = "bab"
Output: 4
Explanation: There are 4 ways to form target.
"bab" -> index 0 ("baab"), index 1 ("baab"), index 2 ("abba")
"bab" -> index 0 ("baab"), index 1 ("baab"), index 3 ("baab")
"bab" -> index 0 ("baab"), index 2 ("baab"), index 3 ("baab")
"bab" -> index 1 ("abba"), index 2 ("baab"), index 3 ("baab")

## Solution
```py
class Solution:
    def numWays(self, words: List[str], target: str) -> int:
        MOD = 10**9 + 7
        m, n = len(target), len(words[0])

        # Precompute frequency of each character at each position in words
        freq = [[0] * 26 for _ in range(n)]
        for word in words:
            for i, char in enumerate(word):
                freq[i][ord(char) - ord('a')] += 1

        # DP table: dp[i][j] is the number of ways to form target[:i] using the first j columns of words
        dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]
        dp[0][0] = 1

        for i in range(m + 1):
            for j in range(n):
                # Carry forward the previous ways
                dp[i][j + 1] = (dp[i][j + 1] + dp[i][j]) % MOD

                if i < m:  # If there's still a character in target to form
                    char_idx = ord(target[i]) - ord('a')
                    # If the current character matches, add ways
                    dp[i + 1][j + 1] = (dp[i + 1][j + 1] + dp[i][j] * freq[j][char_idx]) % MOD

        return dp[m][n]
```
