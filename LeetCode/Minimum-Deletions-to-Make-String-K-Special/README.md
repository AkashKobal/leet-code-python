# Minimum Deletions to Make String K-Special

Can you solve this real interview question? Minimum Deletions to Make String K-Special - You are given a string word and an integer k.

We consider word to be k-special if |freq(word[i]) - freq(word[j])| <= k for all indices i and j in the string.

Here, freq(x) denotes the frequency of the character x in word, and |y| denotes the absolute value of y.

Return the minimum number of characters you need to delete to make word k-special.

 

Example 1:

Input: word = "aabcaba", k = 0

Output: 3

Explanation: We can make word 0-special by deleting 2 occurrences of "a" and 1 occurrence of "c". Therefore, word becomes equal to "baba" where freq('a') == freq('b') == 2.

Example 2:

Input: word = "dabdcbdcdcd", k = 2

Output: 2

Explanation: We can make word 2-special by deleting 1 occurrence of "a" and 1 occurrence of "d". Therefore, word becomes equal to "bdcbdcdcd" where freq('b') == 2, freq('c') == 3, and freq('d') == 4.

Example 3:

Input: word = "aaabaaa", k = 2

Output: 1

Explanation: We can make word 2-special by deleting 1 occurrence of "b". Therefore, word becomes equal to "aaaaaa" where each letter's frequency is now uniformly 6.
