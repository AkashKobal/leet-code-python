Input: words = ["a","aba","ababa","aa"]
Output: 4
Explanation: In this example, the counted index pairs are:
i = 0 and j = 1 because isPrefixAndSuffix("a", "aba") is true.
i = 0 and j = 2 because isPrefixAndSuffix("a", "ababa") is true.
i = 0 and j = 3 because isPrefixAndSuffix("a", "aa") is true.
i = 1 and j = 2 because isPrefixAndSuffix("aba", "ababa") is true.
Therefore, the answer is 4.
