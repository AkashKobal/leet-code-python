# Majority Element

Can you solve this real interview question? Majority Element - Given an array nums of size n, return the majority element.

The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,2,3]
Output: 3


Example 2:

Input: nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
Output: 2

## Solution
```py
class Solution:
    def majorityElement(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        candidate = None
        count = 0

        for num in nums:
            if count == 0:
                candidate = num
            count += (1 if num == candidate else -1)
        
        return candidate


```
