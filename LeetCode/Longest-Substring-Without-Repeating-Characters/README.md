## Solution
```py
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        res = set()
        count = 0
        l = 0
        for r in range(len(s)):
            while s[r] in res:
                res.remove(s[l])
                l+=1
            res.add(s[r])
            count = max(count,r-l+1)
        return count
```
