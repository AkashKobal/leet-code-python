Input: nums = [8,3,9,3,8], k = 2
Output: 81
Explanation: To get a score of 81, we can apply the following operations:
- Choose subarray nums[2, ..., 2]. nums[2] is the only element in this subarray. Hence, we multiply the score by nums[2]. The score becomes 1 * 9 = 9.
- Choose subarray nums[2, ..., 3]. Both nums[2] and nums[3] have a prime score of 1, but nums[2] has the smaller index. Hence, we multiply the score by nums[2]. The score becomes 9 * 9 = 81.
It can be proven that 81 is the highest score one can obtain.
