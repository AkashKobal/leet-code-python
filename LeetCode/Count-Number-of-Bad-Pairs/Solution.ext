Output: 5
Explanation: The pair (0, 1) is a bad pair since 1 - 0 != 1 - 4.
The pair (0, 2) is a bad pair since 2 - 0 != 3 - 4, 2 != -1.
The pair (0, 3) is a bad pair since 3 - 0 != 3 - 4, 3 != -1.
The pair (1, 2) is a bad pair since 2 - 1 != 3 - 1, 1 != 2.
The pair (2, 3) is a bad pair since 3 - 2 != 3 - 3, 1 != 0.
There are a total of 5 bad pairs, so we return 5.
