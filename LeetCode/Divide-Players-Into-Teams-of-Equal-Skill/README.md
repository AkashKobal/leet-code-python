# Divide Players Into Teams of Equal Skill

Can you solve this real interview question? Divide Players Into Teams of Equal Skill - You are given a positive integer array skill of even length n where skill[i] denotes the skill of the ith player. Divide the players into n / 2 teams of size 2 such that the total skill of each team is equal.

The chemistry of a team is equal to the product of the skills of the players on that team.

Return the sum of the chemistry of all the teams, or return -1 if there is no way to divide the players into teams such that the total skill of each team is equal.

Â 

Example 1:


Input: skill = [3,2,5,1,3,4]
Output: 22
Explanation: 
Divide the players into the following teams: (1, 5), (2, 4), (3, 3), where each team has a total skill of 6.
The sum of the chemistry of all the teams is: 1 * 5 + 2 * 4 + 3 * 3 = 5 + 8 + 9 = 22.


Example 2:


Input: skill = [3,4]
Output: 12
Explanation: 
The two players form a team with a total skill of 7.
The chemistry of the team is 3 * 4 = 12.


Example 3:


Input: skill = [1,1,2,3]
Output: -1
Explanation: 
There is no way to divide the players into teams such that the total skill of each team is equal.

## Solution
```py
class Solution:
    def dividePlayers(self, skill: List[int]) -> int:
        # Step 1: Sort the skill array
        skill.sort()
        
        total_skill = skill[0] + skill[-1]  # Required sum for each pair
        chemistry_sum = 0

        # Step 2: Pair players using two pointers
        for i in range(len(skill) // 2):
            # Check if the sum of current pair matches the required total_skill
            if skill[i] + skill[-i - 1] != total_skill:
                return -1  # Invalid configuration, return -1
            # Calculate the chemistry (product of pair) and add it to the sum
            chemistry_sum += skill[i] * skill[-i - 1]

        return chemistry_sum  # Return total chemistry
```
