Input: nums = [0,1,1,3], maximumBit = 2
Output: [0,3,2,3]
Explanation: The queries are answered as follows:
1st query: nums = [0,1,1,3], k = 0 since 0 XOR 1 XOR 1 XOR 3 XOR 0 = 3.
2nd query: nums = [0,1,1], k = 3 since 0 XOR 1 XOR 1 XOR 3 = 3.
3rd query: nums = [0,1], k = 2 since 0 XOR 1 XOR 2 = 3.
4th query: nums = [0], k = 3 since 0 XOR 3 = 3.
