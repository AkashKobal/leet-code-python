Input: original = [1,2,3,4], m = 2, n = 2
Output: [[1,2],[3,4]]
Explanation: The constructed 2D array should contain 2 rows and 2 columns.
The first group of n=2 elements in original, [1,2], becomes the first row in the constructed 2D array.
The second group of n=2 elements in original, [3,4], becomes the second row in the constructed 2D array.
