# Check If N and Its Double Exist

Can you solve this real interview question? Check If N and Its Double Exist - Given an array arr of integers, check if there exist two indices i and j such that :

 * i != j
 * 0 <= i, j < arr.length
 * arr[i] == 2 * arr[j]

 

Example 1:


Input: arr = [10,2,5,3]
Output: true
Explanation: For i = 0 and j = 2, arr[i] == 10 == 2 * 5 == 2 * arr[j]


Example 2:


Input: arr = [3,1,7,11]
Output: false
Explanation: There is no i and j that satisfy the conditions.
