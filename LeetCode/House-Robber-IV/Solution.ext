Input: nums = [2,3,5,9], k = 2
Output: 5
Explanation: 
There are three ways to rob at least 2 houses:
- Rob the houses at indices 0 and 2. Capability is max(nums[0], nums[2]) = 5.
- Rob the houses at indices 0 and 3. Capability is max(nums[0], nums[3]) = 9.
- Rob the houses at indices 1 and 3. Capability is max(nums[1], nums[3]) = 9.
Therefore, we return min(5, 9, 9) = 5.
