# Most Beautiful Item for Each Query

Can you solve this real interview question? Most Beautiful Item for Each Query - You are given a 2D integer array items where items[i] = [pricei, beautyi] denotes the price and beauty of an item respectively.

You are also given a 0-indexed integer array queries. For each queries[j], you want to determine the maximum beauty of an item whose price is less than or equal to queries[j]. If no such item exists, then the answer to this query is 0.

Return an array answer of the same length as queries where answer[j] is the answer to the jth query.

Example 1:


Input: items = [[1,2],[3,2],[2,4],[5,6],[3,5]], queries = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: [2,4,5,5,6,6]
Explanation:
- For queries[0]=1, [1,2] is the only item which has price <= 1. Hence, the answer for this query is 2.
- For queries[1]=2, the items which can be considered are [1,2] and [2,4]. 
  The maximum beauty among them is 4.
- For queries[2]=3 and queries[3]=4, the items which can be considered are [1,2], [3,2], [2,4], and [3,5].
  The maximum beauty among them is 5.
- For queries[4]=5 and queries[5]=6, all items can be considered.
  Hence, the answer for them is the maximum beauty of all items, i.e., 6.


Example 2:


Input: items = [[1,2],[1,2],[1,3],[1,4]], queries = [1]
Output: [4]
Explanation: 
The price of every item is equal to 1, so we choose the item with the maximum beauty 4. 
Note that multiple items can have the same price and/or beauty.  


Example 3:


Input: items = [[10,1000]], queries = [5]
Output: [0]
Explanation:
No item has a price less than or equal to 5, so no item can be chosen.
Hence, the answer to the query is 0.

## Solution
```py
class Solution(object):
    def maximumBeauty(self, items, queries):
        
        maxI = float('inf')
        res = [[0, 0, maxI]]
    
        items.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])

        for price, beauty in items:
            lastBracket = res[-1]
            if beauty > lastBracket[1]:
                res[-1][2] = price
                res.append([price, beauty, maxI])

        ans = []

        for x in queries:
            for i in range(len(res) - 1, -1, -1):
                if res[i][0] <= x:
                    ans.append(res[i][1])
                    break

        return ans
```
