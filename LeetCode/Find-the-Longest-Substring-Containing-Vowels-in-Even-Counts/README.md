# Find the Longest Substring Containing Vowels in Even Counts

Can you solve this real interview question? Find the Longest Substring Containing Vowels in Even Counts - Given the string s, return the size of the longest substring containing each vowel an even number of times. That is, 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', and 'u' must appear an even number of times.

Â 

Example 1:


Input: s = "eleetminicoworoep"
Output: 13
Explanation: The longest substring is "leetminicowor" which contains two each of the vowels: e, i and o and zero of the vowels: a and u.


Example 2:


Input: s = "leetcodeisgreat"
Output: 5
Explanation: The longest substring is "leetc" which contains two e's.


Example 3:


Input: s = "bcbcbc"
Output: 6
Explanation: In this case, the given string "bcbcbc" is the longest because all vowels: a, e, i, o and u appear zero times.

## Solution
```py
class Solution:
    def findTheLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
         # Vowels with their respective bitmask values
        vowels = {'a': 1, 'e': 2, 'i': 4, 'o': 8, 'u': 16}
        
        # Dictionary to store the first occurrence of each bitmask
        # We start with bitmask 0 at index -1, to handle the case when the entire string is valid
        first_occurrence = {0: -1}
        
        # Current bitmask and result variable
        mask = 0
        max_len = 0
        
        # Traverse the string
        for i, c in enumerate(s):
            # If the character is a vowel, update the bitmask
            if c in vowels:
                mask ^= vowels[c]
            
            # If the bitmask has been seen before, calculate the length of the substring
            if mask in first_occurrence:
                max_len = max(max_len, i - first_occurrence[mask])
            else:
                # If this is the first time we've seen this bitmask, store the index
                first_occurrence[mask] = i
        
        return max_len

```
