# Construct Binary Tree from Preorder and Postorder Traversal

Can you solve this real interview question? Construct Binary Tree from Preorder and Postorder Traversal - Given two integer arrays, preorder and postorder where preorder is the preorder traversal of a binary tree of distinct values and postorder is the postorder traversal of the same tree, reconstruct and return the binary tree.

If there exist multiple answers, you can return any of them.

Example 1:

[https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/07/24/lc-prepost.jpg]


Input: preorder = [1,2,4,5,3,6,7], postorder = [4,5,2,6,7,3,1]
Output: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]


Example 2:


Input: preorder = [1], postorder = [1]
Output: [1]

## Solution
```py
class Solution:
    def constructFromPrePost(self, preorder: List[int], postorder: List[int]) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
        # preorder = root, left, right
        # postorder = left, right, root

        def makeTree():            
            node = TreeNode(postorder.pop()) # take root from postorder, now is [left, right]

            if node.val != preorder[-1]: # post = [left, right], pre = [root, left, right]
                node.right = makeTree() # postorder node isn't right leaf, build right subtree

            if node.val != preorder[-1]: # post = [left], pre = [root, left]
                node.left = makeTree() # postorder node isn't left leaf, build left subtree

            preorder.pop() # post = [], pre = [root], root already used for node.val
            return node

        return makeTree() # makeTree returns root of tree
```
