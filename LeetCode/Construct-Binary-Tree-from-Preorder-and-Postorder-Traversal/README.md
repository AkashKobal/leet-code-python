# Construct Binary Tree from Preorder and Postorder Traversal

Can you solve this real interview question? Construct Binary Tree from Preorder and Postorder Traversal - Given two integer arrays, preorder and postorder where preorder is the preorder traversal of a binary tree of distinct values and postorder is the postorder traversal of the same tree, reconstruct and return the binary tree.
