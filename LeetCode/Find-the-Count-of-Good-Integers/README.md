# Find the Count of Good Integers

Can you solve this real interview question? Find the Count of Good Integers - You are given two positive integers n and k.

An integer x is called k-palindromic if:

 * x is a palindrome.
 * x is divisible by k.

An integer is called good if its digits can be rearranged to form a k-palindromic integer. For example, for k = 2, 2020 can be rearranged to form the k-palindromic integer 2002, whereas 1010 cannot be rearranged to form a k-palindromic integer.

Return the count of good integers containing n digits.

Note that any integer must not have leading zeros, neither before nor after rearrangement. For example, 1010 cannot be rearranged to form 101.

Example 1:

Input: n = 3, k = 5

Output: 27

Explanation:

Some of the good integers are:

 * 551 because it can be rearranged to form 515.
 * 525 because it is already k-palindromic.

Example 2:

Input: n = 1, k = 4

Output: 2

Explanation:

The two good integers are 4 and 8.

Example 3:

Input: n = 5, k = 6

Output: 2468
