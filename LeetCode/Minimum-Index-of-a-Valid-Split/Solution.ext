Input: nums = [1,2,2,2]
Output: 2
Explanation: We can split the array at index 2 to obtain arrays [1,2,2] and [2]. 
In array [1,2,2], element 2 is dominant since it occurs twice in the array and 2 * 2 > 3. 
In array [2], element 2 is dominant since it occurs once in the array and 1 * 2 > 1.
Both [1,2,2] and [2] have the same dominant element as nums, so this is a valid split. 
It can be shown that index 2 is the minimum index of a valid split.
