# Tuple with Same Product

Can you solve this real interview question? Tuple with Same Product - Given an array nums of distinct positive integers, return the number of tuples (a, b, c, d) such that a * b = c * d where a, b, c, and d are elements of nums, and a != b != c != d.

 

Example 1:


Input: nums = [2,3,4,6]
Output: 8
Explanation: There are 8 valid tuples:
(2,6,3,4) , (2,6,4,3) , (6,2,3,4) , (6,2,4,3)
(3,4,2,6) , (4,3,2,6) , (3,4,6,2) , (4,3,6,2)


Example 2:


Input: nums = [1,2,4,5,10]
Output: 16
Explanation: There are 16 valid tuples:
(1,10,2,5) , (1,10,5,2) , (10,1,2,5) , (10,1,5,2)
(2,5,1,10) , (2,5,10,1) , (5,2,1,10) , (5,2,10,1)
(2,10,4,5) , (2,10,5,4) , (10,2,4,5) , (10,2,5,4)
(4,5,2,10) , (4,5,10,2) , (5,4,2,10) , (5,4,10,2)

## Solution
```py
class Solution:
    def tupleSameProduct(self, nums):
        products = {}
        ans, n = 0, len(nums)

        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i + 1, n):
                prod = nums[i] * nums[j]
                ans += products.get(prod, 0)
                products[prod] = products.get(prod, 0) + 1

        return ans * 8
```
