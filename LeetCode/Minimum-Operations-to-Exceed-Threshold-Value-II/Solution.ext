Input: nums = [2,11,10,1,3], k = 10
Output: 2
Explanation: In the first operation, we remove elements 1 and 2, then add 1 * 2 + 2 to nums. nums becomes equal to [4, 11, 10, 3].
In the second operation, we remove elements 3 and 4, then add 3 * 2 + 4 to nums. nums becomes equal to [10, 11, 10].
At this stage, all the elements of nums are greater than or equal to 10 so we can stop.
It can be shown that 2 is the minimum number of operations needed so that all elements of the array are greater than or equal to 10.
