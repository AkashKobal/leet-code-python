Input: nums = [1,2,2,1,1,0]
Output: [1,4,2,0,0,0]
Explanation: We do the following operations:
- i = 0: nums[0] and nums[1] are not equal, so we skip this operation.
- i = 1: nums[1] and nums[2] are equal, we multiply nums[1] by 2 and change nums[2] to 0. The array becomes [1,4,0,1,1,0].
- i = 2: nums[2] and nums[3] are not equal, so we skip this operation.
- i = 3: nums[3] and nums[4] are equal, we multiply nums[3] by 2 and change nums[4] to 0. The array becomes [1,4,0,2,0,0].
- i = 4: nums[4] and nums[5] are equal, we multiply nums[4] by 2 and change nums[5] to 0. The array becomes [1,4,0,2,0,0].
After that, we shift the 0's to the end, which gives the array [1,4,2,0,0,0].
