Example 1:

Input: s = "abc"

Output: "abc"

Explanation:

There is no digit in the string.

Example 2:

Input: s = "cb34"

Output: ""

Explanation:

First, we apply the operation on s[2], and s becomes "c4".

Then we apply the operation on s[1], and s becomes "".

## Solution
```py
class Solution:
    def clearDigits(self, s: str) -> str:
        stack = []
        for c in s:
            if c.isdigit():
                if stack:
                    stack.pop()
            else:
                stack.append(c)
        return "".join(stack)
```
