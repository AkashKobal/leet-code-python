Input: candidates = [16,17,71,62,12,24,14]
Output: 4
Explanation: The combination [16,17,62,24] has a bitwise AND of 16 & 17 & 62 & 24 = 16 > 0.
The size of the combination is 4.
It can be shown that no combination with a size greater than 4 has a bitwise AND greater than 0.
Note that more than one combination may have the largest size.
For example, the combination [62,12,24,14] has a bitwise AND of 62 & 12 & 24 & 14 = 8 > 0.
