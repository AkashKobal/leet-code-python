# Find Score of an Array After Marking All Elements

Can you solve this real interview question? Find Score of an Array After Marking All Elements - You are given an array nums consisting of positive integers.

Starting with score = 0, apply the following algorithm:

 * Choose the smallest integer of the array that is not marked. If there is a tie, choose the one with the smallest index.
 * Add the value of the chosen integer to score.
 * Mark the chosen element and its two adjacent elements if they exist.
 * Repeat until all the array elements are marked.

Return the score you get after applying the above algorithm.

 

Example 1:


Input: nums = [2,1,3,4,5,2]
Output: 7
Explanation: We mark the elements as follows:
- 1 is the smallest unmarked element, so we mark it and its two adjacent elements: [2,1,3,4,5,2].
- 2 is the smallest unmarked element, so we mark it and its left adjacent element: [2,1,3,4,5,2].
- 4 is the only remaining unmarked element, so we mark it: [2,1,3,4,5,2].
Our score is 1 + 2 + 4 = 7.


Example 2:


Input: nums = [2,3,5,1,3,2]
Output: 5
Explanation: We mark the elements as follows:
- 1 is the smallest unmarked element, so we mark it and its two adjacent elements: [2,3,5,1,3,2].
- 2 is the smallest unmarked element, since there are two of them, we choose the left-most one, so we mark the one at index 0 and its right adjacent element: [2,3,5,1,3,2].
- 2 is the only remaining unmarked element, so we mark it: [2,3,5,1,3,2].
Our score is 1 + 2 + 2 = 5.

## Solution
```py
class Solution:
    def findScore(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        score = 0
        n = len(nums)
        q = deque()

        # Traverse through the array
        for i in range(n):
            # If queue is not empty and the current number is greater than or equal to the last in queue
            if q and nums[i] >= q[-1]:
                skip = False
                # Process the elements in the queue
                while q:
                    add = q.pop()
                    if not skip:
                        score += add
                    skip = not skip
                continue

            # Add current element to the queue
            q.append(nums[i])

        # Final processing of remaining elements in the queue
        skip = False
        while q:
            add = q.pop()
            if not skip:
                score += add
            skip = not skip

        return score
```
