Input: nums = [4,6,1,2], k = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: In this example, we apply the following operations:
- Choose index 1, replace it with 4 (from range [4,8]), nums = [4,4,1,2].
- Choose index 3, replace it with 4 (from range [0,4]), nums = [4,4,1,4].
After the applied operations, the beauty of the array nums is 3 (subsequence consisting of indices 0, 1, and 3).
It can be proven that 3 is the maximum possible length we can achieve.
