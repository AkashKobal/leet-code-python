# Maximum Score After Splitting a String

Can you solve this real interview question? Maximum Score After Splitting a String - Given a string s of zeros and ones, return the maximum score after splitting the string into two non-empty substrings (i.e. left substring and right substring).

The score after splitting a string is the number of zeros in the left substring plus the number of ones in the right substring.

 

Example 1:


Input: s = "011101"
Output: 5 
Explanation: 
All possible ways of splitting s into two non-empty substrings are:
left = "0" and right = "11101", score = 1 + 4 = 5 
left = "01" and right = "1101", score = 1 + 3 = 4 
left = "011" and right = "101", score = 1 + 2 = 3 
left = "0111" and right = "01", score = 1 + 1 = 2 
left = "01110" and right = "1", score = 2 + 1 = 3


Example 2:


Input: s = "00111"
Output: 5
Explanation: When left = "00" and right = "111", we get the maximum score = 2 + 3 = 5


Example 3:


Input: s = "1111"
Output: 3

## Solution
```py
class Solution:
    def maxScore(self, s: str) -> int:
        max_score = count_zeros_left = 0
        count_ones_right = s.count('1')

        for i in range(len(s) - 1):
            count_zeros_left += s[i] == '0'
            count_ones_right -= s[i] == '1'
            max_score = max(max_score, count_zeros_left + count_ones_right)

        return max_score
```
