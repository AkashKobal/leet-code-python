Input: s = "011101"
Output: 5 
Explanation: 
All possible ways of splitting s into two non-empty substrings are:
left = "0" and right = "11101", score = 1 + 4 = 5 
left = "01" and right = "1101", score = 1 + 3 = 4 
left = "011" and right = "101", score = 1 + 2 = 3 
left = "0111" and right = "01", score = 1 + 1 = 2 
left = "01110" and right = "1", score = 2 + 1 = 3
