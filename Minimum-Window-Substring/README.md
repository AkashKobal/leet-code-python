# Minimum Window Substring

Can you solve this real interview question? Minimum Window Substring - Given two strings s and t of lengths m and n respectively, return the minimum window substring of s such that every character in t (including duplicates) is included in the window. If there is no such substring, return the empty string "".

The testcases will be generated such that the answer is unique.

Â 

Example 1:


Input: s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"
Output: "BANC"
Explanation: The minimum window substring "BANC" includes 'A', 'B', and 'C' from string t.


Example 2:


Input: s = "a", t = "a"
Output: "a"
Explanation: The entire string s is the minimum window.


Example 3:


Input: s = "a", t = "aa"
Output: ""
Explanation: Both 'a's from t must be included in the window.
Since the largest window of s only has one 'a', return empty string.

## Solution
```py
class Solution:
    def minWindow(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:
        if not s or not t or len(s) < len(t):
            return ""

        map = [0] * 128
        count = len(t)
        start = 0
        end = 0
        min_len = float('inf')
        start_index = 0
        # UPVOTE !
        for char in t:
            map[ord(char)] += 1

        while end < len(s):
            if map[ord(s[end])] > 0:
                count -= 1
            map[ord(s[end])] -= 1
            end += 1

            while count == 0:
                if end - start < min_len:
                    start_index = start
                    min_len = end - start

                if map[ord(s[start])] == 0:
                    count += 1
                map[ord(s[start])] += 1
                start += 1

        return "" if min_len == float('inf') else s[start_index:start_index + min_len]
```
